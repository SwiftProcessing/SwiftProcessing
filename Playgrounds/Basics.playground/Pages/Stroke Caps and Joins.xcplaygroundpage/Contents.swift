 ## Stroke Joins and Caps
 
 ### Introduction
 
 It's important to be able to control the look of your lines and behavior of your corners. There are 3 types of caps and 3 types of joins that you can use in SwiftProcessing.
 
 ### Stroke Join
 
 To set the stroke join you can use the `strokeJoin()` function. This function takes a `StrokeJoin` enum as its parameter. There are 3 types of stroke joins: `.miter`, `.bevel`, and `.round`. Below is what it looks like to use the `strokeJoin()` function:
 
 ```
 strokeJoin(.bevel)
 ```
 Below are definitions and illustrations ([source](https://processing.org/reference/strokeJoin_.html)) of each option:
 
`.miter` creates an angular joint.

`.bevel` bevels off the point using a straight edge.

`.round` rounds each corner.

 ### Stroke Cap
 
 To set the stroke cap you can use the `strokeCap()` function. This function takes a `StrokeCap` enum as its parameter. There are 3 types of stroke joins: `.round`, `.square`, and `.project`. Below is what it looks like to use the `strokeCap()` function:
 
 ```
 strokeCap(.round)
 ```
 Below are definitions and an illustration ([source](https://processing.org/reference/strokeCap_.html)) of the options in order:
 
 `.round` rounds the end as if you were to draw a circle with a diameter the size of the `strokeWeight`.
 
 `.square` cuts the the line off squarely directly at the endpoint.
 
 `.project` is similar to `.round` except it's as if you draw a square with a centerpoint of your endpoint outward the size of the `strokeWeight`.
