 # Coordinates and Basic Shapes
 ### by Masood Kamandy
 
 Getting started drawing on a computer means we have to learn how to place things with a ***coordinate system*** and a few basic shapes. In this lesson we'll learn about 6 basic shapes. We call these shapes ***primitives***.
 
 ## Coordinate System
 
 In computer graphics we always need to be able to tell a computer **where** to place things on the screen. For this, we use a ***coordinate system***. If you remember geometry class, you'll remember using graph paper or drawing out your own graphs. We use a similar system but it's slightly different.

 In SwiftProcessing we use (x,y) coordinates just like in math. X is the horizontal position and Y is the vertical position. The coordinate (0,0) is at the top left corner of the screen. (25,50) would be 25 pixels to the right and 50 pixels down.
 
 ## Basic Shapes
 
 The 6 basic shapes we'll learn here along with their syntax:
 
 1. Line - `line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
 1. Triangle - `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
 1. Quad - `quad(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)`
 1. Rect - `rect(x, y, width, height)`
 1. Ellipse - `ellipse(x, y, width, height)`
 1. Arc - `arc(x, y, width, height, start, stop)`
 
 ## Let's draw some shapes!
