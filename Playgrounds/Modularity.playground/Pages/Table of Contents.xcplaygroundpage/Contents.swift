//: ## Modular Code
//:
//: One of the most powerful things you can do with code is write code that works and use it in multiple projects. There are a lot of ways to wrap up your code so you can move it around. In all of our coding so far we've been using a lot of *functions* and *objects*. In this section you'll learn to make your own functions and objects that accomplish specific tasks and make it easier to organize your code!

//: ## Image Processing and the Camera
//:
//: We already learned about images. Now we're going to go a little deeper in a couple of different ways. We'll go beneath the surface of images and look at pixels and we'll take a look at using the camera to capture an image.
