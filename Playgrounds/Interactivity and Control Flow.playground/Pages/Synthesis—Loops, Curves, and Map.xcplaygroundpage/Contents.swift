 # Synthesisâ€”Loops, Curves, and Map
 ### by Masood Kamandy for GSoC 2021
 
 ## Introduction
 
 There are some more complex shapes that can't be drawn with the primitives. Imagine that you're tracing the silhoette of a body or that you're creating a complex figure with points that are generated by your program. For this purpose, we can create our own shapes.
 
 ## Basic Structure of a Shape
 
 When creating complex shapes in SwiftProcessing, you use the following structure:
 
 1. Use `beginShape()` to start your shape.
 1. Draw the vertices of your ship using `vertex(x, y)` for polygons or `curveVertex(x, y)` for curves.
 1. Use `endShape()` for an open shape or `endShape(.close)` for a closed shape.
 
 ## Polygons and Curves
 
 There are two types of shapes you can create in SwiftProcessing. One is the **polygon** and the other is a **curve**. Both polygons and curves can be constructed as **open** or **closed**.
 
 ### Polygons
 
 Here is a simple example of creating a **polygon** that is **open** with 5 random points. You can place this in `setup()` or `draw()` with different results.
 
 ```
 noFill()
 stroke(255)
 beginShape()
 for _ in 0..<5 {
     vertex(random(width), random(height))
 }
 endShape()
 ```
 
 ### Curve
 
 A similar **curve** can be created with the following code. This time let's **close** the shape.
 
 ```
 fill(255)
 stroke(255, 0 ,0)
 beginShape()
 for _ in 0..<5 {
     curveVertex(random(width), random(height))
 }
 endShape(.close)
 ```
 
 **Note**: The vertices of a curve are also called **control points.**
 
 ## Let's create a closed curve with control points that bounce around the screen.
