//: # Interactivity and Control Flow
//:
//: ## Conditional Logic and Loops
//:
//: In order to really take advantage of the power of programming you will need to learn *branching* and *repeating*. This is a category of actions called *control flow*.
//:
//: * [Conditional Logic](Conditional%20Logic)
//: * [For and While Loops](For%20and%20While%20Loops)
//: * [Synthesis—Loops and Rotate](Synthesis%E2%80%94Loops%20and%20Rotate)
//:
//: ## Collections and Manipulating Variables
//:
//: In this section you'll learn the concept of collections which will allow you to group variables of the same type together. You'll also learn techniques to remap (using `map()`) and smooth (using `lerp()`) the input of variables.
//:
//: * [Arrays](Arrays)
//: * [Map and Lerp](Map%20and%20Lerp)
//: * [Synthesis—Loops, Curves, and Map](Synthesis%E2%80%94Loops,%20Curves,%20and%20Map)
//:
//: ## Interactivity
//:
//: Now we'll move on to some foundational ideas in programming that will enable you to get the most out of Swift:
//:
//: * [Touch and Animation](Touch%20and%20Animation)
//: * [Sliders](Sliders)
//:
//: ## Another Core Swift Concept
//:
//: Optionals may be unique for those who have not programmed in Swift before. They make programming safer and allow you to declare variables and initalize them when you need them:
//:
//: * [Optionals](Optionals)
//:
//: ## Multimedia
//:
//: Now we'll move on to some foundational ideas in programming that will enable you to get the most out of Swift:
//:
//: * [Images](Images)
//: * [Animated GIFs](Animated%20GIFs)
//: * [Microphone Input](Microphone%20Input)
