 # Sliders
 ### by Masood Kamandy for GSoC 2021
 
 ## Introduction

 Sliders can be an important part of any touch-based interface. They enable users to control attributes interactively.
 
 For the creative coder, a slider means you can tweak aspects of your work without needing to change code. It can save time and allow for more fine-grained control of your artworks.
 
 ## Sliders
 
SwiftProcessing comes with a built in slider class that enables quick and easy set up of sliders. To create a slider you'll need to first initialize it.
 
 You might be asking what a *class* is. We'll get there in a future lesson. For now, just know
 
 Sliders have their own attributes to access with a **dot modifier**. The sliders attributes are:
 
 * `x` - x position of the upper left-hand corner of the slider.
 * `y` - y position of the upper left-hand corner of the slider.
 * `width` - width of the slider
 * `height` - height of the slider
 * `value` - the current value of the slider
 
 The dot modifier works like this: when you declare an object,
